## Use Case Diagram
Use-case diagrams describe the high-level functions and scope of a system. These diagrams also identify the interactions between the system and its actors. The use cases and actors in use-case diagrams describe what the system does and how the actors use it, but not how the system operates internally.

## Class Diagram
A class diagram is a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that represents the structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects. It is commonly used in software engineering to model and design object-oriented systems.
